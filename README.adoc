== Usage

It allows to:

* set/reset independently each output
* read actual value and set-point of voltage
* read actual value and set-point of current

You can't set voltage and/or current via this tool. I found it dangerous to control such parameters without knowing what is on the other side of psu output.

== Configuration

It supports simple configuration via `config.json`, nothing need to be explained here.
